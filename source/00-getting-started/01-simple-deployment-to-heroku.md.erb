A very simple guide to use Snap to deploy a sample application to Heroku. Follow these steps and see your app deployed in a few minutes.


## Get setup 

Sign up for:

* [Github] (http://www.github.com/) and validate your email address

* [Heroku] (http://www.heroku.com/) and choose Ruby as your primary development langauge

* [Snap CI] (http://www.snap-ci.com/) and authorize Snap CI to access your Github account

## Fork this repository 

* Login to Github and fork this repository

* You should now see the snapci-ruby-heroku as one of your Github repositories as: github-userid/snapci-ruby-heroku

## Add forked repository to Snap CI

* Go to [Snap CI] (www.snap-ci.com)

* Add the snapci-ruby-heroku build. The build should start and run the two default stages - FastFeedback and Integration. 

## Customise your build

* Select “Customize it here” 
* From the build pipeline screen click on the "Add Stage" button 
* From the commonly used stages click on “Deploy” and select “Ruby” 
* Then select “Basic” under “Heroku” 
* Supply your Heroku credentials
* Specify an application name. Don't use upper case characters and make it unique (we suggest you include your user ID)
* Save the configuration


## Your app is deployed to Heroku using Snap CI

* Snap CI will build and deploy your app to Heroku
* Navigate to your new app (e.g. heroku-app-name.heroku.com).  
* Celebrate!
