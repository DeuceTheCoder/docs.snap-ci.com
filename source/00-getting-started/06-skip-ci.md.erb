Some little changes, like update the README file, may not require your pipeline to run. For scenarios like this, Snap gives you an option to skip the build.

# How can I skip a build?

* Include **[skip ci]** or **[ci skip]** into your commit message and Snap will ignore it

* In case you have multiple commits in the same push, Snap will look for the message of the latest one
