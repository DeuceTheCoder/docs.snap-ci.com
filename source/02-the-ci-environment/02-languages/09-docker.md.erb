Docker support on Snap CI support is in beta and is only enabled for some users. 

If you would like to try these features please contact us at [Snap CI support] (support@snap-ci.com).

Snap CI provides support for building, testing and deploying Docker images. You can use the commands listed at  to use Docker on Snap CI.

We support version x.x.x.

## Building, test and deploy Docker containers on Snap CI

In this project example we build a Docker container for a dummy NodeJS app and run and test it before publishing to a registry.

#Add image of pipeline
#Add image of stage config

This example: 
* Builds a Docker image based on the steps in its Dockerfile 
* Creates a new container based on that image with the Docker run command and starts the app inside it
* Runs a simple test against the container
* Deploys the freshly built image to DockerHub

If you would like to create this yourself follow this quickstart guide.

As Snap CI allows for customisable stages in the deployment pipeline an alternative example of this would be to pull the different steps out into independent stages. You can see an example of that on [Snap CI] .
