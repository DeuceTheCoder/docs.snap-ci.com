Docker and deployment pipelines are a perfectly complementary with each other. Once a docker image is built, it can be propagated through a pipeline. The exact same image can be deployed to multiple different environments. The fact that the image is a completely self-contained instance of the packaged service, complete with the application code, configuration information and everything else required to run your application reduces the potential for the dreaded snowflake server antipattern.

Here is how you can build and propate a Docker image through a pipeline in Snap.
