Snap provides a quick and easy way to deploy simple apps using OpsWorks.

To get started

* Edit your project configuration
* Select the "Deploy" recipes
* Then select the "Elastic Beanstalk Deploy" recipe
* Define some secure environment variables to hold your AWS credentials `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* Tweak the command to change the `APP_NAME`, `ENV_NAME`, `S3_BUCKET` and `region` argument to match your deployment.
